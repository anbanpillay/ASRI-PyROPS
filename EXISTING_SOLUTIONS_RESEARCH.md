### 5.2 OpenRocket Detailed Fit Analysis

#### 5.2.1 Advantages
- Excellent GUI (easier for non-programmers)
- Very mature (15+ years)
- Large user community
- Extensive motor database

#### 5.2.2 Disadvantages for PyROPS Use Case

- **Aerodynamic Workflow**: Uses built-in calculations, not external RASAero/DATCOM files
  - Cannot directly import PyROPS aerodynamic databases
  - Would require re-running aerodynamic analysis in OpenRocket's built-in tools
- **Scripting**: Requires JPype bridge (clunky)
- **Focus**: Model rocketry (<100kg), PyROPS targets larger research rockets
- **Limited Liquid Motors**: No detailed liquid motor support

#### 5.2.3 Migration Effort from PyROPS to OpenRocket

**Minimal Effort**:
- Basic rocket design (GUI is easy)
- Standard simulations
- Monte Carlo

**High Effort**:
