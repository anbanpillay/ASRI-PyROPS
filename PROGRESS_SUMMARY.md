   - Understand coordinate systems and conventions
   - Optional: Run Jupyter notebook examples

2. **Prepare for Phase 2: Benchmark Extraction** (Critical!)
   - Identify 3-5 "golden" test cases from PyROPS
   - Criteria for selection:
     - Well-validated simulations
     - Cover different flight regimes
     - Exercise major features (hybrid motor, parachute, etc.)
   - Gather all input files for selected cases
   - Prepare PyROPS for benchmark runs

### This Week
3. **Phase 2, Days 3-4: Extract Benchmarks** ⚠️ CRITICAL PHASE
   - Document test case parameters
   - Run PyROPS simulations
   - Record reference outputs (apogee, velocity, trajectory, etc.)
   - Archive all data
   - **DO NOT SKIP - Validation depends on this**

4. **Phase 3, Days 5-6: Data Conversion**
   - Convert RASAero Excel files to CSV
   - Convert thrust curves
   - Convert atmosphere data
   - Convert wind profiles
   - Validate conversions

## ⚠️ Critical Reminders

1. **VALIDATION IS MANDATORY**
   - Extract benchmarks before proceeding to implementation
   - All PyROPS physics must be preserved
   - 0.1% tolerance for key metrics
   - Physics team sign-off required

2. **DO NOT SKIP BENCHMARKING**
   - Phase 2 (Days 3-4) is critical
   - Cannot validate without reference data
   - Schedule this as highest priority

3. **KEEP PYROPS INTACT**
   - Do not modify `ASRI_Simulator/` folder
   - Needed for benchmark comparisons
   - Archive after migration complete

4. **GIT DISCIPLINE**
   - Commit after each phase
   - Use descriptive messages
   - Current branch: main
   - Consider creating feature branch for implementation

## 📈 Performance Comparison (Projected)

| Metric | PyROPS | RocketPy (Expected) | Improvement |
|--------|--------|---------------------|-------------|
| Single Simulation | 1-5 min | <10 sec | 10-30x faster |
| Monte Carlo (1000 runs) | 24-48 hours | <2 hours | 12-24x faster |
| Code Quality | Poor | Excellent | ✓ |
| Validation | Informal | Peer-reviewed | ✓ |
| Cross-platform | No (Windows) | Yes | ✓ |
| Documentation | Minimal | Excellent | ✓ |

## 📝 Notes

- RocketPy 1.10.0 uses slightly different attribute names than expected:
  - `max_speed` instead of `max_velocity`
  - `max_mach_number` for Mach
  - `x_impact`, `y_impact` for landing position
  - Documentation will be updated with correct naming

- Virtual environment uses Python 3.13.5 (latest stable)
- All packages installed via `uv pip` (fast installer)
- Example simulation runs cleanly without warnings

---

**Status**: On track, ahead of schedule (completed Day 1 in <1 day)
**Next Session**: Complete familiarization, prepare for benchmarking
**Blockers**: None
**Risks**: Need to allocate time for benchmark extraction (critical path)
