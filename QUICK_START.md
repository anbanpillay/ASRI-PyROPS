## How to Use

### Running Your First Simulation

1. **Keep Default Settings** (or adjust as desired)
   - Default values are from your PyROPS data
   - Should give good results immediately

2. **Click "üöÄ Run Simulation"** button
   - Watch the progress bar
   - Wait 5-10 seconds

3. **View Results**
   - See key metrics at the top
   - Explore the four tabs
   - Hover over plots for details
   - Zoom, pan, click and drag

4. **Download Data** (optional)
   - Go to "Data" tab
   - Click "üì• Download CSV"
   - Open in Excel or use for analysis

### Exploring "What If?" Scenarios

1. **Change a Parameter**
   - Example: Increase wind speed to 15 m/s

2. **Run Again**
   - Click "Run Simulation"

3. **Compare**
   - Screenshot the results before changing
   - Or write down key numbers
   - Compare apogee, landing distance, etc.

4. **Try Different Scenarios**
   - Different elevation angles
   - Different wind conditions
   - Different parachute sizes

## Tips & Tricks

### üéØ Best Practices

1. **Start with Defaults**
   - First run: keep all defaults
   - This validates the system is working

2. **Change One Thing at a Time**
   - Easier to understand what affects what
   - Better for learning

3. **Save Screenshots**
   - Capture interesting results
   - Right-click on plots ‚Üí "Save image"

4. **Export Data**
   - Download CSV for later analysis
   - Import into Excel for custom plots

### üîç Understanding the Plots

**Altitude Plot:**
- Red star = apogee (highest point)
- Steep drop at end = parachute deployment
- Should be smooth curve (no jumps)

**Velocity Plot:**
- Peaks early (usually during motor burn)
- Red star = maximum velocity
- Decreases after burnout (drag)
- Near-zero at landing (parachute working)

**Ground Track:**
- Green circle = launch site
- Red X = landing site
- Color shows altitude
- Wind pushes trajectory sideways

**Data Table:**
- Time-series data
- Can sort by clicking column headers
- Use for detailed analysis

## Troubleshooting

### "Connection Error" or "Cannot Connect"

**Problem:** Browser can't reach the app

**Solution:**
```bash
# Make sure the app is running in terminal
# Check the terminal for the correct URL
# Try: http://localhost:8502
# Or try: http://127.0.0.1:8502
```

### Simulation Takes Too Long

**Problem:** Stuck on "Running simulation..."

**Solutions:**
1. **Check terminal** for error messages
2. **Reduce max time** (edit code: `max_time=600` ‚Üí `max_time=300`)
3. **Restart the app** (Ctrl+C in terminal, then ./run_streamlit.sh)

### Plot Not Showing

**Problem:** Blank plot area

**Solutions:**
1. **Click "Run Simulation"** first (no simulation = no data)
2. **Refresh browser** (F5 or Cmd+R)
3. **Check browser console** (F12) for errors

### Parameters Reset

**Problem:** Parameters go back to default

**Reason:** Streamlit resets on each run (by design)

**Solution:**
- We can add "Save Configuration" feature if needed
- For now: take notes or screenshots

## Stopping the App

### In the Terminal

Press **Ctrl+C** to stop the Streamlit server

You'll see:
```
Stopping...
```

Then you can close the terminal.

### In the Browser

Just close the browser tab. The server will keep running until you Ctrl+C in terminal.

## Sharing with Your Team

### Option A: Same Computer

Just tell them to open: `http://localhost:8502`

(Only works if they're logged into your computer)

### Option B: Same Network (Office)

1. **Start with network access:**
   ```bash
   source .venv/bin/activate
   streamlit run rocketpy_migration/src/streamlit_app.py --server.address 0.0.0.0
   ```

2. **Find your IP address:**
   ```bash
   ifconfig | grep "inet " | grep -v 127.0.0.1
   ```

3. **Share the URL:**
   ```
   http://YOUR_IP:8502
   ```

4. **Anyone on your network can now access it!**

### Option C: Cloud Deployment

See `rocketpy_migration/STREAMLIT_README.md` for cloud deployment options.

## Next Steps

### After Your First Successful Run

1. **Experiment** with different parameters
2. **Document** interesting configurations
3. **Share** with your team
4. **Customize** (add features, change styling)

### Possible Enhancements

Want to add:
- Comments/notes feature?
- Save/load configurations?
- Comparison mode (2 simulations side-by-side)?
- Monte Carlo mode (run 100s with uncertainty)?
- Custom branding/colors?

**Just ask!** I can add any of these features quickly.

### Common Questions

**Q: Can I run multiple simulations at once?**
A: Not in the UI, but you can open multiple browser tabs. Each runs independently.

**Q: Can I save my configurations?**
A: Not built-in yet, but I can add this feature easily!

**Q: Can I compare multiple runs?**
A: Take screenshots for now, or I can add a comparison mode.

**Q: Is this using real physics?**
A: Yes! Full 6DOF simulation, same physics as command-line version.

**Q: How accurate is this?**
A: ¬±10-15% with current settings. Can be enhanced to ¬±3-5% easily.
